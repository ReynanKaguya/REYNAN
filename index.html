				<h4>My Favorite quote of all time</h4>
				<p>"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever" Don‚Äôt be afraid to live life and try something new, let life be the reason you are living.Life is something you live to the fullness and learn throughout it. Being afraid to live and learn in life is not something a person should be doing. ‚ÄúLive as if you were to die tomorrow.‚Äùthis will push you to do things in life that you always wanted to do because your life is almost up and ‚ÄúLearn as if you were to live forever.‚Äù learning since you can live forever is the most important in life if you decide to live forever. Learning is not something you get bored of, rather it is something you take in.</p>
